###About DVD Pila!
<br/>

The word <strong>Pila</strong> is Spanish for Pile, and I have a pile of DVDs that I'd like to rip and record that I have ripped them.

This project is also an excuse to learn Ember.js and use the Bourbon SASS mixin library.

Here are some additional projects that DVD Pila! uses:

| Project       | Reason        |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| [Python](https://www.python.org/)             | The server is written in Python, so we'll go ahead and list it first.                                 |
| [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)              | Basically used for database CRUD operations, and I've wanted to learn Flask for a while.              |
| [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)         | Have to be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database from Python, and this does the job, woo.        |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)      | A cool database I have wanted to use for a while, and you gotta store your data somewhere.            |
| [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)               | The project was started as an excuse to learn this great framework.                                   |
| [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) | Integrated REST API to database.                                                                      |
| [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)                 | A lot more fun writing CSS with SASS                                                                  |
| [Bourbon Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) | I'm not great at making things look good, and having pre-defined elements is great.                   |
| [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)             | This great library of JavaScript time functions isn't used that much, but it's worth a mention.       |
| [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)        | A dependency of Ember, but a great JavaScript template system that I'd like to use in other projects. |

Smoosh all these projects together with some code from various blogs, StackOverflow questions, etc, and I give you DVD Pila!.

Hope you enjoy!

Party On!
