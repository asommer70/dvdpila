###About DVD Pila!
<br/>

The word <strong>Pila</strong> is Spanish for Pile, and I have a pile of DVDs that I'd like to rip and record that I have ripped them.

This project started as an excuse to learn Ember.js and use the Bourbon SASS mixin library.  For version 3.0 the project morphed into a Ruby on Rails app and has become an excuse to learn React.js... at least at some point.

Here are some additional projects that DVD Pila! relies on:

| Project       | Reason        |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)         | Without Ruby there would be no Rails, but Ruby is a great language for a lot of things. |
| [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)      | Probably the best website framework out there. After using several Rails allows fast and easy development of great database backed sites. |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)      | A cool database I have wanted to use for a while, and you gotta store your data somewhere.            |
| [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)                 | Not sure what the web would look like today without jQuery, but it would sure as heck be a log less friendly. |
| [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)     | Makes things look good and has a lot of UX baked in. |
| [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)                 | A lot more fun writing CSS with SASS                                |
| [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)      | Manipulating video playback is made a lot easier with CoffeeScript. |
| [Dragonfly](http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/) | Makes file upload very easy for images, files, etc. |

Smoosh all these projects together with some code from various blogs, StackOverflow questions, etc, and I give you DVD Pila!.

Hope you enjoy!

Party On!
