<p>One thing I'm starting to miss about Rails is the automagic of CRUD operations for model classes.  Not that's it's a big deal to code up a few functions to respond to PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE.  The way Rails does all that automatically is very nice.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess I've started working on creating, editing, and deleting Episode objects in <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a>, and it feels like it's going slowly becuase I have to do all the "plumbing" manually.  Though there is probably a nice Flask plugin that can do similar things as ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>I've started wondering if I might have to migrate DVD Pila! to Rails, or another "full" featured, framework.  I think with only two models, and another one coming, that a simple Flask server will be adequete.  Also, since DVD Pila! is designed to run on a home LAN it's not like "scale" is a major concern.</p>

<p>It's also kind of fun to get built up from the ground up...</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
