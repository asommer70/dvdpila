Just wanted to create a quick post to get the word out about a new guide I've been working on.  The reason is mostly because there wasn't a lot of good guides on using the Ember Data project with an actual REST server.  There are plenty of guides for Ember and Ember Data, but they all use fixture data and it makes things harder to figure out when you're using an actual server.
</p>

<p>
I was able to muddle my way through, but based on the likes and comments form my <a href="http://codepen.io/asommer70/blog/">Daily Dev Blog</a> there is a shortage of good documentation on using Ember Data with actual REST servers.  Hopefully the guide I'm working on will help someone else... I totally know it will help me learn the Ember stack better.
</p>

<p>
Another thought I had was to sell the guide on Gumroad for a $0.99 just to see if there is interest in this kind of thing.  I am also planning on sending it to the DVD Pila! mailing list as a bonus for signing up.

<p>
I guess we'll see how things go.

<p>
Party On!
