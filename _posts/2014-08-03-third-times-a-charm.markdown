<p>Made a new release of <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a>.  Version 1.2 should now work as expected.  </p>

<p>I tidied up some of the display CSS as well to make each "dvd block" have the same height and width.  This makes things look a  lot better.  Things just look better when they are in neat little rows.  I haven't tested the latest release in my <em>production</em> setup yet as we are travelling this weekend.  Hopefully I won't have to release version 1.3 until some time in the future.  At least a couple of months from now would be nice.</p>

<p>I think for the month of July I'm going to do as little development on DVD Pila! as possible.  Instead of cranking out more code/features I'm going to learn as much as I can about marketing a software product. I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growth-Hacker-Marketing-Advertising-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B00BPDR3JM" rel="nofollow">"Growth Hacker Marketing"</a> a few weeks ago and really loved it.  It's a great place to start getting the word out about your product.  Of course the main advise in growth hacking is to start marketing before you build anything.</p>

<p>Doing the marketing first helps you arrive at Product Market Fit, which means you actually make something people want.  In the case of DVD Pila! I was totally scratching my own itch.  If people don't want it no big deal.  It does what I set out to do when starting the project, and I learned a lot about Flask and Ember.js.  Learning was the real goal.</p>

<p>Wonder if I should start a <em>Daily Marketing Blog</em>?  Maybe on Linkedin...</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
