<p>So things are moving right along, and have the signup eBook download process working the way I'd like.  Works fine with my testing anyway, hopefully when/if people actually sign up for the mailing list it'll continue to work.</p>

<p>I ended up using the <a href="http://zurb.com/ink/" rel="nofollow">Ink</a> framework to develop the email template.  The template looks good to me in both the Gmail Android app and Gmail web app using Chrome.  That's all that really matters... I guess.  I really like the <a href="http://zurb.com/ink/inliner.php" rel="nofollow">Ink Inliner</a> tool that Zurb provides.  It really blows up the HTML, but seems to work great from my testing.  Wish they released a command line version though.  That reminds me that I should really look into finding another inliner, I know they're out there.</p>

<p>I also worked on setting up a HTML template in MailChimp, but ran into some problems getting things where I can actually add/edit text.  I think I need to go back to their examples and figure out what kind of code blocks I need to add to make certain areas editable.  I did this some to include the list preferenc links in the footer, but I need to test the variables and what not.</p>

<p>One more step along the path to actually marketing this monster full time... well part time anyway.</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
