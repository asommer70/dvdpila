I admit I had a hard time coming up with a subject for this weeks blog post.  I haven't done anything new with developing DVD Pila!, and I don't have any new archiving tips this week.

I do have a list of ideas for DVD Pila! that I think are worth going over.

## Blog Focus

I've sort of been struggling about what the focus for this blog, and the mailing list for that matter, should be.  When I first started it I re-posted content from my daily dev [blog](http://codepen.io/asommer70/blog/), and that seemed a great way to cross promote and generate content.

I think sharing how the project is developed does have some value and I'll continue to do that, but I also had the idea to create more content about how to archive and organize your DVDs.  That has been the focus of the last few posts (with an odd dev post in there).

Here are some other blog content ideas (they may or may not be good):

* Movie reviews.
* Finding sources for DVDs (though you shouldn't archive them if you don't own them).
* Different ways to view archived content.
* Marketing Open Source projects.

I'm sure that over time a focus will present itself, and it may be something totally different than what I've done in the past, or what I think will happen in the future.

## DVD Pila! Features

Another area where I've had some ideas is where DVD Pila! itself should go.  I've outlined a few features for version 2.0:

* SQLAlchemy Integration
* Tags with sorting.
* Have an "episodes" element to view multiple videos inside a DVD page.
* A "bookmark" feature that enables you to save the location of a video and jump to that point whenever you'd like.

I've also been learning Android development over the last few weeks, and had the idea of creating a pure mobile version of DVD Pila!.  This shouldn't really be that hard because the backend just feeds the Ember.js frontend with JSON.  Seems like it wouldn't be that hard to write up some Java to grab that backend JSON and create similar Views.

Lot's of ideas...


Party On!
