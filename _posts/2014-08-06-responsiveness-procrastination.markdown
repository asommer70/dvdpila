<p>In a previous <a href="http://codepen.io/asommer70/blog/third-times-a-charm" rel="nofollow">post</a> I mentioned that the next step for DVD Pila! is to start marketing it.  Well that was going to be the next step until I started using the app and got very annoyed at some of the bugs I didn't realize were there.</p>

<p>Bugs are fixed so it's time for the marketing right?  Not quite. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm procrastinating (it definitely feels like I'm procrastinating), but instead of working on the marketing I've been working on making the app responsive.  I'd like to be able to use the site from my tablets and phones, but that wasn't really a major feature.  I think even with the HTML5 supported videos you have to use an third party apps to play them on Android and iOS.  I haven't done a lot of testing though.</p>

<p>I think I'm scared of criticism if I post <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> to places like Reddit and Hacker News.  I guess I'm just going to have to get over it and plow through.  Otherwise what's the point?</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
