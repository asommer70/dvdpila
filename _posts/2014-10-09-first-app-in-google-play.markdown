<p>So I released my first Android app today. You can grab it for <strong>$0.99</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thehoick.barcodepost" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  I would have charged $0, but that wasn't an option.  I could have made it free, but I guess once you make it free you can never charge for it, and I wanted the option to maybe charge for it in the future.  I like having the option to make it free sometime down the road.</p>

<p>The app probably isn't that useful for a wide audience, but there might be a small focused group of people that will find it perfect for what they need to do.  Which is scanning barcodes with a phone.</p>

<p>I developed this little app to help with my DVD archive project.  I've already created the web app <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> to keep track of which DVDs I've already archived.  </p>

<p>So my next project (which may or may not be a portfolio site) is to add the ability in DVD Pila! to recieve a barcode lookup the barcode on Yoopsie and create a new DVD object in the database.  Should be pretty easy since I've already done most of the steps in the BarcodePOST already.  </p>

<p>Need to finish migrating the data model to SQLAlchemy in DVD Pila! as well.</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
