<p>At some point in my <a href="http://emberjs.com/" rel="nofollow">Ember.js</a> learning I came across some simple snippets that implement a "star" rating widget.  I thought I had either booked marked the page in my <a href="https://pinboard.in" rel="nofollow">Pinboard</a>, or saved a link in Evernote, but when I went to find it I was straight up denied by the gods of the internets.</p>

<p>Not to get too down in the dumps because I found <a href="http://www.toptal.com/javascript/a-step-by-step-guide-to-building-your-first-ember-js-app" rel="nofollow">this</a> great guide for building an Ember app.  At the bottom is an example of implementing a star rating widget.  It worked as advertised for me, but I'm sure there are other ways of doing this.</p>

<p>After implementing <a href="http://balinterdi.com/" rel="nofollow">Balint Erdi's</a> code, I needed a star icon, image, or what have you.  In the example they use the great <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap</a> framework and use it's icon font to render the star/s.  Since I'm not using Bootstrap in my project I had to come up with another solution.  I could hunt up a font icon set and use that, but after reading <a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/ten-reasons-we-switched-from-an-icon-font-to-svg/" rel="nofollow">posts like this</a> I've been thinking for small projects maybe using straight SVG files is better.  I then found the <a href="https://useiconic.com/open/" rel="nofollow">Open Iconic</a> SVG library, and boom star icon acquired.</p>

<p>I only implemented the star rating on the main list page, but I probably will integrate it into the DVD edit page at some point.</p>

<p>Paty On!</p>
