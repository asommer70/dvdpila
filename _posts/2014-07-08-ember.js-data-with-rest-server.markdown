<p>For whatever reason, maybe I'm just dense, I've been having a very hard time connecting Ember.js Data with a simple REST server written in Flask that queries one table in PostgreSQL.  Sounds simple enough, and I could smash togther some jQuery, or even Angular.js, code to push and pull JSON to and from the Flask server.  I'd like to use Ember Data though.</p>

<p>I think a lot of my confusion is coming from when to call the createRecord method to save the data to the server via HTTP POST.  I can send the POST call, but the request has no data and therefore Flask can't save anything to the database.  </p>

<p>A big frustration for me is that though there are some great tutorials, especially the one on <a href="http://courses.tutsplus.com/courses/lets-learn-ember" rel="nofollow">Tuts+</a> all seem to use fixture data and not live database calls.  Fixture data would be fine, I guess, but I'm still blasting my head up against the wall trying to get Ember to send data.</p>

<p>Thought I'd start a daily development blog and use this platform at least until/if things get crazy.</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
