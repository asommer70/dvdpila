<p>The next part of the <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> mailng list signup project, is to develop some sweet email templates.  Having done a lot of these for a small web development company a few months ago, I feel that this shouldn't be a big problem.  It might even be fun.</p>

<p>Developing HTML email templates is like creating websites for GeoCities.  You know that awesome site building service from back in 1995.  At least that's when I was first exposed to GeoCities and building websites with tables.  I'm not going to talk about how long I still used tables as layout elements for websites (cough... 2010.. cough).</p>

<p>Anyhoo, I used the <a href="http://reallygoodemails.com/" rel="nofollow">Really Good Emails</a> site as inspiration for a couple of templates I created recently.  I'm not that good at coming up with cool designs so I'm totally "stealing like an artist", "faking it till I make it", etc when it comes to web design.  I guess you could also say that about my web development.</p>

<p>I came across this <a href="https://www.sendwithus.com/resources/templates" rel="nofollow">cool page</a> with some Open Source email templages, and I'll try to use a couple for the DVD Pila! eBook download and mailing list emails.  I've also used the <a href="http://zurb.com/ink" rel="nofollow">Ink</a> framework for a template and might use it again.</p>

<p>Part On!</p>
