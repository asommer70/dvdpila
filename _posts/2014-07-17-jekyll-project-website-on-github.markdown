<p>I'm working on a website for the <a href="https://github.com/asommer70/dvdpila" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> project, and working with the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> static site generator.  The documentation is a quick read and so far has been detailed enough to answer any question's I've had.</p>

<p>Working with Jekyll a few minutes gave me ideas for multiple other sites that could be a good fit.  So many ideas, so little time...</p>

<p>It's also very easy to integrate SASS mixins with Jekyll by creating a <em>_sass</em> directory in the base site folder and adding a couple of lines to the <em>_config.yml</em> file.  I've integrated Bourbon and freinds into the project site and setup the same basic theme/template as the Ember.js web app.  I should include some links in the web app that point back to the project page.</p>

<p>I've read about Jekyll in <a href="http://joshkaufman.net/" rel="nofollow">Josh Kaufman's</a> book <a href="http://first20hours.com/" rel="nofollow">The First 20 Hours</a>, but at the time I didn't think I'd ever find a use for it.  I highly recommend this book, and yes, after I read it I went out and bought an ukulele.</p>

<p>Looking forward to finishing the project page, and putting it out there.</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
