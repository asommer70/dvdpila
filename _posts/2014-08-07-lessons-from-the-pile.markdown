<p>Having finally arrived at a stable release with <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> I wanted to post a recap of the things I've learned during it's development.  Most of what I learned is development related, but hopefully in the near future I'll start learning more marketing lessons from this project.</p>

<p>Not sure if this list is totally comprehensive or not, but is should be pretty close:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://emberjs.com/" rel="nofollow">Ember.js</a>

<ul>
<li>It's on my list of cool projects for quite a while, and I totally used this project as an excuse to dive into the pool of JavaScript goodness that is Ember.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Flask</a>

<ul>
<li>Another project that I've wanted to use for a while.  Flask was a joy to develop with for the server side, and I'll probably totally use it for other projects in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a>

<ul>
<li>I don't think I learned much new about PostgreSQL, but it was fun to use for this project.  I have a few ideas to use the JSON data type in other projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Release testing

<ul>
<li>Seems obvious, but I really should have done better testing before creating releases on <a href="https://github.com/asommer70/dvdpila/releases" rel="nofollow">Github</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/api" rel="nofollow">Duck Duck Go API</a>

<ul>
<li>A cool feature of DVD Pila! is that if the DVD title is unique enough the server can pre-populate most of the fields from search results provided by Duck Duck Go.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://bourbon.io/" rel="nofollow">Bourbon</a> and Friends

<ul>
<li>I think this is my third project that I've used Bourbon Refills for element styling, and I did learn more about Neat and Bitters as well.</li>
<li> Not to mention getting better with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="nofollow">Sass</a> as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a>

<ul>
<li>Used for the <a href="http://dvdpila.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">DVD Pila!</a> web site which is hosted on Github pages.</li>
<li>I really liked using Jekyll to build the site and handle the Sass files, posts, etc.</li>
<li>Will probably use Jekyll for my upcoming portfolio site.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I think that covers most of the learnings for this project to date.  I've said it before, but I think this is the first "self itch straching" project that I'll actually end up using regularly.  </p>

<p>Who knows maybe I'll even start a feature list for 2.0...</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
