excerpt: <p>Just realized that it's been two days since I posted in this blog.  I had a streak going of a few months there, but this weekend we had company over, actually two sets of company, and totally spaced posting something.  Maybe I should change the format to only post something useful?  Then I'd have to change the name of the blog I guess...</p>

<p>Just realized that it's been two days since I posted in this blog.  I had a streak going of a few months there, but this weekend we had company over, actually two sets of company, and totally spaced posting something.  Maybe I should change the format to only post something useful?  Then I'd have to change the name of the blog I guess...</p>

<p>This weekend, and some on Friday, I finally got around to setting up a portfolio site.  You can find mine <a href="http://thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It's pretty simple, and there's not a lot of customization except colors from the standard Refills elements.</p>

<p>I decided a few months ago to focus on using just a few technologies for web sites in order to stay focused as much as possible.  My list so far includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flask as the server.</li>
<li>Ember.js for JavaScript framework.</li>
<li>Bourbon Refills for design framework.</li>
<li>Jekyll for static sites.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL for database.</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy for ORM.</li>
</ul>

<p>So as you can imagine the portfolio site is a Jekyll site using Bourbon Refills and for the hero unit background I used the very cool <a href="http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/" rel="nofollow">Trianglify</a> project.  I also used this for the device backgroun on the <a href="http://barcodepost.thehoick.com" rel="nofollow">BarcodePOST</a> project page.</p>

<p>I've been thinking that I might have to find an additional design framework because the last couple of sites sort of look a lot alike.  I could also customize the sites more though.</p>

<p>I might just need a better layout technique than a center column with different sections...</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
