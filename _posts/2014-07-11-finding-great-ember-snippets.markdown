<p>After this morning's hour of coding I was able to implement search.  Well more of a filter really, but it amounts to the same thing.  Yay for regex.  </p>

<p>I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19767733/build-search-box-searching-with-ember-js" rel="nofollow">this</a> great StackOverlfow post that details implementing a search filter of an ArrayController.  There is also an explanation of the code in the answer comments.  I found it enlightening.</p>

<p>After publishing yesterday's post, I had some additional coding time before bed, and implemented some validations in Ember.js.  I know I'm probably doing it wrong, but my code works so pffft.  I also setup flash messages from <a href="http://coderberry.me/blog/2013/06/20/using-flash-messages-with-emberjs/" rel="nofollow">this great post</a> by Eric Barry.  It works like a charm, but I might like a more Railsy flash message that sticks around until you click a close button... we'll see about adjusting that later.</p>

<p>Things are moving along, and it's now a lot of fun to develop using Ember.js.  Next up IMDB integration...</p>

<p>Party On!</p>
